1. Making of auth Middleware
2. Getting hold of req.headers["authorization"]
3. Taking out token from from authHeaders = req.headers
4. If token is false, then return Token Required.
5. If token is true, then verify token by the use of JWT.
6. If not verified then return err -> Invalid Token.
7. If verified then, fetch variable userId = decoded.id and then set user = await userModel.findById(userId).
8. If user not found then return -> User not found in auth.
9. If user found then return -> req.user = user and next().
